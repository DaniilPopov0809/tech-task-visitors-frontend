## Description of the project
Service for manual registration of visitors in the building in which the frontend and [backend](https://github.com/DaniilPopov0809/tech-task-visitors-backend) are involved with data recording in a file.

3. You can add, delete or update a visitor to the table.
4. The table can be filtered by name, patronymic and time of entry into the building
5. When deleting, changing or creating a visitor, the data in the table is updated
6. Information about the deletion, change or creation of a visitor
7. Automatic redirection of the user in case of switching to non-existent route
